# SelenicSparkApp2 Angular

# Project was abandoned because I have no interest in researching monolithic architectures any further, 3rd iteration of the app is in progress (using microservices). 

Second version of my [SelenicSparkApp project](https://github.com/HardcoreMagazine/SelenicSparkApp).  
This repository is a front-end part of the project.


## WORK IN PROGRESS
